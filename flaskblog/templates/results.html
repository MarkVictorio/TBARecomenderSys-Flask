    <h5>What is Collaborative Filtering and What Do the Results Mean?</h5>
    <p>Once all participants have finished taking the exam, The User-User Collaborative Filtering Algorithm will give out recommendations for each question for each participant. The User-User Collaborative Filtering Algorithm takes  the results of each participant and generates expected results based on the collaborative results of all participants. Students with answers that are similar to yours will have a bigger influence on your expected results </p>
    <p>The CF Results and Recommendations may be interpreted as the result the algorithm expects you to score, using the rest of the class as a basis; where similar students have a higher influence on your expected output</p>
    <p>The recommendations provided by the algorithm are merely suggestions and may not be completely accurate. You may interpret the results however you would see fit </p>
